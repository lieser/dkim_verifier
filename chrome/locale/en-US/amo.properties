amo.summary = Verifies the DKIM-Signatures of e-mails.

amo.description = <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail">DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)</a> is a method which allows domains to sign e-mails. The add-on verifies these DKIM signatures and shows the result in the e-mail header. This way it is possible to see which domain is claiming responsibility for a specific e-mail. How the result is shown can be changed in the options.\n\nIt is important to note that an e-mail can be signed by an arbitrary domains. A valid DKIM signature alone is therefore not an indicator for a trustworthy e-mail. Always check who the signer is to determine if an e-mail is trustworthy!\n\nIn some cases, the absence of a DKIM signature can be useful to identify scam e-mails. If it is known that a certain domain is signing all its e-mails with DKIM, the absence of a DKIM signature is a strong indicator for a forged e-mail.\n\nTo ease the checking of if and by who an e-mail is signed, the add-on supports the use of sign rules. With sign rules it is possible to specify that e-mails from a certain sender have to be always signed by a specific domain (also referred to as SDID). More about sign rules at https://github.com/lieser/dkim_verifier/wiki/Sign-rules.\n\nA description of all the available add-on options can be found at https://github.com/lieser/dkim_verifier/wiki/Options.

amo.developerComments = Support is given at https://github.com/lieser/dkim_verifier/issues, http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=2704121 or by e-mail to lieser+dkim@posteo.net (in English or German).\n\nThe preferred way to report bugs is by creating an issue at https://github.com/lieser/dkim_verifier/issues.

amo.privacyPolicy = The Add-on queries a DNS Server (default Google Public DNS (8.8.8.8) or the one configured in the OS) for a TXT record specified in the signature, which contains the public key of the signature.\nThis will happen every time an e-mail with a DKIM Signature is viewed.\n\nIf the use of DMARC is enabled additional DNS lookups may be done, even if not DKIM signed e-mail are viewed.
